Wuornos had exhibited unusual sexual behavior as a child before leaving home as a teen and had multiple brushes with the law by the 1980s, when she made a living as a sex worker on Florida’s highways. Her killing spree started around late November 1989 and earned her the nickname “Damsel of Death.” After being arrested in January 1991, she confessed to seven murders before receiving death sentences in the six cases brought against her. Although her sanity was questioned, Wuornos was executed by lethal injection in October 2002 at age 46. In addition to documentaries, books, and an opera, her story was depicted in the 2003 movie Monster, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/charlize-theron data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Charlize Theron" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Charlize Theron</a>, and more recently, 2021’s Aileen Wuornos: American Boogeywoman.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Aileen Carol Wuornos<br>BORN: February 29, 1956<br>DIED: October 9, 2002<br>BIRTHPLACE: Rochester, Michigan<br>SPOUSE: Lewis Fell (1976)<br>CHILD: 1 son<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Young Aileen Wuornos" data-anchor-id=young-aileen-wuornos class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Young Aileen Wuornos</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Aileen Wuornos was born as Aileen Carol Pittman on February 29, 1956, in Rochester, Michigan. Her parents, Diane Wuornos and Leo Pittman, divorced before her birth. After Diane, a teen mother, abandoned Aileen and her older brother, Keith, Diane’s parents legally adopted the two young children. Aileen never knew her biological father, who was eventually imprisoned for child rape and died by suicide while in custody.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Aileen grew up in nearby Troy, Michigan, with her adoptive parents, Keith, and two older adoptive siblings (her biological aunt and uncle). A fire scarred her face when she was a young girl. She developed an explosive temper and found it difficult to make friends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around age 10, Wuornos learned that her parents were actually her biological grandparents. (Media reports later drew comparisons between Wuornos and serial killer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/ted-bundy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ted Bundy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ted Bundy</a>, who was also raised believing his grandparents were his parents for several years.) This knowledge added more tension to an unhappy household; her grandfather Lauri was a harsh disciplinarian who once had Wuornos watch him drown a kitten. Wuornos later stated she was physically and sexually abused by her grandfather and had sexual relations with her brother during childhood.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As an 11-year-old, Wuornos was offering sexual favors to boys she knew if they paid her or gave her cigarettes, resulting in the derogatory nickname “cigarette pig.” Sex work further isolated Wuornos from her peers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wuornos ran away from home on multiple occasions and eventually was sent to juvenile detention. At 14, Lauri sent a pregnant Aileen to a Detroit home for unwed mothers. She told her family the pregnancy was the result of rape but later offered different explanations.

The two started an intense 4.5-year relationship and began living together. While Moore held jobs as a housekeeper or maid, Wuornos engaged in sex work along Florida highways.

He was last seen on November 30, 1989. According to Moore’s testimony, the next day, Wuornos told Moore she had killed a man. On December 13, 1989, Mallory’s body was found at an illegal dumping site in the woods.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Five more dead men were discovered over subsequent months. The body of construction worker David Spears, 43, was found on June 1, 1990. Part-time rodeo worker Charles Carskaddon, 40, went missing on May 31, 1990; his remains were found on June 6. On August 4, 1990, five days after he was reported missing, salesman Troy Burress, 50, was found dead. Charles “Dick” Humphreys, 56, a child abuse investigator, was found on September 12, 1990<strong>. </strong>Walter Antonio, a trucker and reserve police officer who was in his 60s, was discovered on November 19, 1990.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Throughout this time, Wuornos often returned home with new possessions to pawn and cars that she had “borrowed.” She used a variety of aliases when she pawned items belonging to her victims, which made tracking her more difficult. But in July 1990, authorities examined the vehicle of Peter Siems, a 65-year-old missionary who’d gone missing the previous month. Witnesses described seeing Wuornos and Moore leave the car, and a print from the door handle was a match for Wuornos.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 title="Arrest, Trial, and Conviction" data-anchor-id=arrest-trial-and-conviction class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Arrest, Trial, and Conviction</h2><img alt="a brick building has a large sign outside advertising the last resort bar, several large trees are in the background as well as a pay phone and parked cars" title="The Last Resort Bar" width=3072 height=2001 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/exterior-of-last-resort-bar-where-murderer-aileen-wuormos-news-photo-1702997148.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Aileen Wuornos was arrested at The Last Resort bar in Port Orange, Florida, on January 9, 1991.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the fall of 1990, reports that authorities were looking for two women suspected of murder prompted Moore to flee Florida and leave Wuornos. On January 9, 1991, Wuornos was arrested at The Last Resort bar in Port Orange, Florida, on an outstanding charge. Soon afterward, police tracked down Moore in Pennsylvania; she made a deal to gather evidence against Wuornos in order to avoid prosecution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In mid-January, Wuornos admitted to murder in a phone call with Moore, saying she’d committed her crimes because she was desperately in love and wanted them to stay together. After her phone confession to Moore, and against the advice of counsel, police videotaped Wuornos as she confessed to seven murders. The public was fascinated by the case, due in part to the lurid nature of the crimes and erroneous media descriptions of Wuornos as the country’s first female serial killer. She was dubbed “the Damsel of Death.” Among the people who reached out to Wuornos were an evangelical Christian couple, who went on to legally adopt her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wuornos was first prosecuted for Mallory’s murder. During the January 1992 trial, Wuornos asserted she had been raped and assaulted by Mallory, details that didn’t match her video confession. Although not revealed in court, Mallory had previously served time for attempting sexual assault. However, no other sex workers came forward to recount a previous violent encounter with Mallory.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A jury found Wuornos, then 35, guilty of first-degree murder and robbery on January 27, 1992. The judge gave Wuornos the death penalty on January 31. Two months later, Wuornos opted to plead no contest to the murders of Spears, Burress, and Humphreys. She then submitted separate guilty pleas for the murders of Carskaddon and Antonio. She received a death sentence for each plea. Siems’ body has not been recovered, and Wuornos wasn’t charged with his murder.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wuornos initially maintained she had killed her victims in self-defense, though she later retracted these statements. Police believed she had killed men who’d either picked her up or had stopped to help her on the highway.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 title="Death and Last Words" data-anchor-id=death-and-last-words class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Death and Last Words</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a decade on death row, Wuornos decided to fire her appeals lawyers, who were working for a stay of execution. Although a court-appointed attorney argued that comments made by Wuornos suggested she was profoundly disconnected from reality, in April 2002, the Florida Supreme Court ruled she was able to fire her attorneys.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early October 2002, Florida Governor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/jeb-bush data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jeb Bush" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jeb Bush</a> lifted a temporary stay of execution after three psychiatrists deemed Wuornos mentally competent to understand the death penalty and the reasons for its implementation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wuornos was executed by lethal injection on October 9, 2002, in Starke, Florida.
